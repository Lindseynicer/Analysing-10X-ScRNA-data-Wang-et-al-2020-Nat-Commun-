I reproduced the ScRNA analysis for a Nat Comm paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14296-y#Sec2


Wang, X., Xu, H., Cheng, C., Ji, Z., Zhao, H., Sheng, Y., ... & Zhu, H. H. (2020). Identification of a Zeb1 expressing basal stem cell subpopulation in the prostate. Nature communications, 11(1), 1-16.


Here's my modified and updated script to reproduce the works. You may download the html file to have a look at the analysis report and the generated figures.
